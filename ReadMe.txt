Delivery System

The System is made to take in orders and gives back the total time an order will need to reach the Customer.
I have used SpringBoot for making the code in JAVA.
I have made a main application which calls other services to fulfill the orders.
There are 4 Packages namely Repositories, Models, Services and Enums.
Repositories are used to store the tables. Have used In memory to store the data in List and Maps.
Models are the DTOs used for accessing the data in ordered way.
Services are used for calculation of complete process and final time taken for delivery.

To run the code we just need to compile the code like any other JAVA code. Dependencies will be downloaded automatically.
